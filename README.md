# PDF.js with Hypothesis Annotation on Mobile Device  

Hypothesis annotation on mobile device is possible via browser extension (on kiwi & firefox, for example) and [via.hypothes.is](http://via.hypothes.is). However, the former doesn't support pdf; the latter requires to host the pdf on certain server in advance, which is tedious and sometime impractical.

This web app modify [hypothesis/pdf.js-hypothes.is](https://github.com/hypothesis/pdf.js-hypothes.is) and enable user to view and annotate pdf directly on mobile device, or any device without extension installed.

Please enter [here](https://structseeker.github.io/hypothes.is.pdf.pwa/index.html) and follow the instruction to annotate your pdf file.

## TODO

Make it a PWA
